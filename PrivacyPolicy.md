Chatbot saves your credentials so as to login on Academic Management System (AMS) of Manipal on your behalf and show you the data.
We save your credentials in our secure database on Amazon Web Service (AWS) with tight permissions. Our accounts are secured via Multi-Factor Authentication.

Chatbot does not do any data anaylsis as of now, it only shows the data that is on the your AMS page.

We do NOT share any of your data with anyone for any experiment. But to increase the productivity, we might use the data to improve the chatbot and add more functionality.

For example, we can use all your previous semester data to show you your performance. Or the chatbot can inform you whether it is wise to miss the classes.
