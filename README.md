# Manipal Commune Bot

This is the source of the Facebook Messenger chatbot for the upcoming online magazine, Manipal Commune.

Manipal Commune will be run by the students of the Manipal University Jaipur. It is not approved or affiliated by the university.
What this means is that even this project is done by the students independently.

Current features of chatbot include...
- Ability to check Attendance.
- Ability to check Marks.

When the development goes well, the chatbot can be extended to include many features like informing students of holidays and latest events in university.
Also telling them if they are getting detained in any subjects, how many more classes they can miss, natural language processing, etc.

Current commit only incldues the main source file, and not the entire structure. `package.json`, `claudia.json` and  `.env` files are missing.

Written in Node.js with help of Claudia Bot Builder. It runs on AWS Lambda, and uses the MCBotCrawler for purpose of crawling and parsing marks.

Any issues, please open it here itself.
Setting-up instructions to be uploaded soon. Plus missing files also will be uploaded :)
